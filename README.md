# MowerApp
Next Steps:
Add all needed drive vars to app and esp32
 -Phase1(wheelspeeds, bladespeeds) phase2(height, headlights) 

Add all needed reporting vars to app and esp32
 -Phase1(wheelspeeds, bladespeeds, bladepower,voltage) phase2(height, headlights, rssi) 
 
Record session as csv and save to phone with GPS coord and timestamp.

Then I just have to create the hardware to support all the reporting functionality
